# TF2JailRedux-WeaponBlocker
Weapon blocker made explicitly for TF2Jail Redux

There are 2 versions of the plugin, yet both operate the exact same. However, \*WeaponBlocker2 is future proof and will not break in the case that a new weapon is added that falls under the wearable classname. Setup guide and description is found [here](https://github.com/Scags/TF2-Jailbreak-Redux/wiki/Config-Design).
