# TF2JailRedux-WeaponBlocker
Weapon blocker made explicitly for TF2Jail Redux

The weapon blocker is able to uniquely managed weapons in 3 separate gamemodes: normal gameplay, freedays, and wardays. A descriptive guide to setting up the config can be found [here](https://github.com/Scags/TF2-Jailbreak-Redux/wiki/Config-Design).
